# 590PR Final_Project
Fork from here to create your final project repository.

Two things are different than all the previous assignments in 590PR regarding the permissions settings:

1. Please KEEP the "All_Students" team to have Read access.  
2. Whenever you choose to, you are welcome to change your Final Project repository to private or to public.  This will enable you to list it in your resume, website, or other portfolio.

DELETE these lines from TEMPLATE up.

TEMPLATE for your report to fill out:

# Title: 

## Team Member(s) & Summary:
(Note: Don't put your email addresses here (since this is public).  If a student wants their NAME hidden as well, due to optional FERPA regulations, they can be listed purely by their GitHub ID).

If there are multiple students in your team, give a summary of which parts were done by each one. Note that GitHub commits from all members are expected to also show evidence of collaboration.

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:

## All Sources Used:
